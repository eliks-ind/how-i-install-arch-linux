Full description of how I install arch linux

1. Open up [arch download website]("https://archlinux.org/download") and download the ISO file.

2. Make a bootable device. Download [Rufus]("https://rufus.ie/en/") and open the exe file. You need to select you future bootable flash drive and then select the ISO you have downloaded. I use default settings and just press START button. After It shows Ready, Congrats! You have created an arch linux bootable device.
