### 2. Check Internet Connectivity

- **If using Ethernet:** You can skip this step since Ethernet usually works out of the box.
- **If using Wi-Fi:**
  - Test your connection by typing:
    ```bash
    ping google.com
    ```
  - If no connection, launch the interactive Wi-Fi setup tool:
    ```bash
    iwctl
    ```
